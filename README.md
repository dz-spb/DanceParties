# DanceParties

This is an ASP.NET Core application sample: simple dance party keeper with add/remove/list functionality. Download sources, set MainDatabase connection string in appsettings.json/appsettings.Development.json (you need installed SQL Server), create and fill database by SQL scripts from DanceParties.DataEntities project, then build and run solution.

Technologies: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, xUnit, React (my first experience with this framework:) )

Deployed to Microsoft Azure (as App Service): http://danceparties.azurewebsites.net/
